= The Internals Of Apache Spark Online Book

The project contains the sources of https://books.japila.pl/apache-spark-internals[The Internals Of Apache Spark] online book.

== Toolz

The project uses the following toolz:

* https://antora.org/[Antora] which is touted as _The Static Site Generator for Tech Writers_.

* http://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] (with some https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor])

* https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages[GitHub Pages]

* https://atom.io/[Atom editor] with https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-asciidoc-preview[Asciidoc preview] plugin

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] to https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/antora-container/#run-the-antora-image[run the Antora image]

It's all to make things harder..._ekhm_...reach higher levels of writing zen.

== Generating Book

In order to generate the book, use the commands as described in https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.0/antora-container/[Run Antora in a Container].

Below are the steps I'm taking to deploy a new version of the site.

```
$ docker run -u $UID --privileged -v `pwd`:/antora --rm -t antora/antora antora-playbook.yml

// alternatively and recommended
$ docker run --entrypoint ash --privileged -v `pwd`:/antora --rm -it antora/antora

// Inside the container
/antora # antora version
2.3.1

/antora # antora local-antora-playbook.yml

// On your local computer (outside the container)
$ open .out/local/index.html
```

**IMPORTANT**: If your Antora build does not seem to work properly, use `docker run ... --pull`. This resets your cache.

== Not Sphinx?! Why?

Read https://medium.com/@jaceklaskowski/giving-up-on-read-the-docs-restructuredtext-and-sphinx-674961804641[Giving up on Read the Docs, reStructuredText and Sphinx].

== GitHub Flavored writing flow

While on writing route, I'm also aiming at mastering the git(hub) flow to write the book as described in https://medium.com/@chacon/living-the-future-of-technical-writing-2f368bd0a272[Living the Future of Technical Writing] (with pull requests for chapters, action items to show progress of each branch and such).

The branching and task progress features embrace the concept of working on a branch per chapter and using pull requests with https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub Flavored Markdown] for Task Lists. Once the tasks are defined, GitHub shows progress of a pull request with number of tasks completed and progress bar.

.Pull request with 4 tasks of which 1 is completed
