= BroadcastManager

*BroadcastManager* is a Spark service to manage xref:ROOT:spark-broadcast.adoc[broadcast variables] in a Spark application.

.BroadcastManager, SparkEnv and BroadcastFactory
image::BroadcastManager.png[]

BroadcastManager assigns <<nextBroadcastId, unique identifiers>> to broadcast variables.

BroadcastManager is used to create a xref:scheduler:MapOutputTrackerMaster.adoc#BroadcastManager[MapOutputTrackerMaster]

== [[creating-instance]] Creating Instance

BroadcastManager takes the following to be created:

* [[isDriver]] isDriver flag
* [[conf]] xref:ROOT:spark-SparkConf.adoc[SparkConf]
* [[securityManager]] SecurityManager

BroadcastManager is created when SparkEnv is xref:core:SparkEnv.adoc[created] (for the driver and executors and hence the need for the <<isDriver, isDriver>> flag).

== [[broadcastFactory]] BroadcastFactory

BroadcastManager manages a xref:core:BroadcastFactory.adoc[BroadcastFactory]:

* It is created and initialized in <<initialize, initialize>>

* It is stopped in <<stop, stop>> (and that is all it does)

BroadcastManager uses the BroadcastFactory when requested to <<newBroadcast, newBroadcast>> and <<unbroadcast, unbroadcast>>.

== [[nextBroadcastId]] Unique Identifiers of Broadcast Variables

BroadcastManager tracks broadcast variables and controls their identifiers.

Every <<newBroadcast, newBroadcast>> is given a new and unique identifier.

== [[initialize]][[initialized]] Initializing BroadcastManager

[source, scala]
----
initialize(): Unit
----

initialize creates a <<broadcastFactory, TorrentBroadcastFactory>> and requests it to xref:core:TorrentBroadcastFactory.adoc#initialize[initialize].

initialize turns `initialized` internal flag on to guard against multiple initializations. With the initialized flag already enabled, initialize does nothing.

initialize is used once when BroadcastManager is <<creating-instance, created>>.

== [[stop]] Stopping BroadcastManager

[source, scala]
----
stop(): Unit
----

stop requests the <<broadcastFactory, BroadcastFactory>> to xref:core:BroadcastFactory.adoc#stop[stop].

== [[newBroadcast]] Creating Broadcast Variable

[source, scala]
----
newBroadcast[T](
  value_ : T,
  isLocal: Boolean): Broadcast[T]
----

newBroadcast requests the xref:core:BroadcastFactory.adoc[current `BroadcastFactory` for a new broadcast variable].

The `BroadcastFactory` is created when <<initialize, BroadcastManager is initialized>>.

newBroadcast is executed for xref:ROOT:spark-SparkContext.adoc#broadcast[`SparkContext.broadcast` method] and when xref:scheduler:MapOutputTracker.adoc#serializeMapStatuses[`MapOutputTracker` serializes `MapStatuses`].
